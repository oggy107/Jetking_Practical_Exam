Q -> How to fund Goreli test network with test ether in Metamask?

1. open a browser and search "goerlifaucet.com".
2. this will open a goerli faucet website powered by alchemy.
3. enter your wallet address and click "Send Me ETH" button.
4. NOTE: goerli faucet is going to deprecate by the end of this year so it is very hard to get goerli. This faucet needs you to have minimum mainnet balance of 0.001 ETH in your wallet.
5. if you meet the requirements (0.001 ETH in mainnet) you can easily get goerli from this faucet.
6. once transaction is complete you will be able to see goerli balance in your wallet (2.png).
